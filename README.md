Navel Biodiversity Dashboard
In this assignment, I was given a dataset of belly button biodiversity, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels, and to create a interactive dashboard to explore   that dataset.

Dropdown Menu
The landing page will start with the first Subject ID information as well as data visuals. The dropdown menu contains the Subject ID's that the user can choose to see the plotted data on that subject. 

Bar Chart
This graph shows the top 10 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) and the amount found of each OTU. The user can hover their cursor over the desired bar to display the OTU label.

Bubble Chart
The bubble chart utilizes the same data as the bar chart but with more color and different perspective. Hovering the cursor over a bubble will also show the OTU label.
